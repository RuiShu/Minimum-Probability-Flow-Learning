% which differ by a single bit flip.

% K_dK_ising_allbitflipextension corresponds to a slightly modified choice
% of connectivity for MPF. This modified connectivity includes an
% additional connection between each state and the state which is reached
% by flipping all bits.  This connectivity pattern performs better in cases
% (like neural spike trains) where activity is extremely sparse.
