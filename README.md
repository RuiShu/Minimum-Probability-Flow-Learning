Minimum Probability Flow learning (MPF)
================================

MPF is a technique for parameter estimation in un-normalized probabilistic models. It is described in the paper:

> Minimum probability flow learning<br>
> International Conference on Machine Learning (2011)<br>

This repository builds on the work done by Sohl-Dickstein, combining the use of MPF with the use of an auxiliary Markov Random Field in order to make edge weight estimation embarrassingly parallel.
